                    <h1>Instagram</h1>
                    <p>Long the home of influencers, brands, bloggers, small business owners, friends and everyone in
                        between, Instagram has topped well over 1 billion monthly users. If you’re wondering whether a
                        meaningful segment of your audience spends time on the platform, the answer is almost surely a
                        resounding yes.

                        Who’s on Instagram (and Why): Instagram has become one of the most popular social media
                        platforms
                        for teens and young adults, especially in the U.S. Use of the app slowly drops off with age but
                        stays consistent across both men and women, so if your customers are under 40, then Instagram
                        can’t
                        be ignored.

                        The Content that Works Best on Instagram: Beautiful photography, stunning visuals, unique
                        designs,
                        selfie-style video that speaks directly to your audience and a cohesive theme to your content
                        will
                        help you stand out on Instagram.

                        You Should Prioritize Instagram if: Your target audience is under the age of 40, you run a
                        lifestyle, ecommerce, or photography business.</p>

                    <h1>YouTube</h1>
                    <p>YouTube hails as the second most popular search engine in the world today, right behind its
                        parent
                        company, Google. If your business could benefit from producing video tutorials or walkthroughs,
                        visually-driven instructional content, product reviews or interviews, then this social media
                        platform is a must for reaching their more than 2 billion monthly users.

                        Who’s on YouTube (and Why): A whopping 73% of U.S. adults report regularly using YouTube, with a
                        heavy concentration in the age range of 15 to 34 years olds. YouTube is broadly popular amongst
                        both
                        men and women, and usage tends to go up alongside income and level of education.

                        The Content that Works Best on YouTube: Video only. Depending upon your type of business and who
                        your audience is, both long-form and short-form video content can work very well on this
                        platform.
                        Most viewers tune in for a combination of education and entertainment, so whether you’re
                        teaching
                        your audience about emerging marketing tactics or streaming video gameplay, work hard to retain
                        their attention throughout your videos. You might also consider tapping into popular YouTube
                        trends
                        like unboxing videos (especially if you rep a physical product) and “with me” content that takes
                        viewers along with you for the ride. Additionally, if starting a YouTube channel feels
                        ambitious,
                        partnering with YouTube influencers who are excited about your mission could help you test the
                        waters before you dive in.

                        You Should Prioritize YouTube if: Your audience is below the age of 50 and consumes video
                        content as
                        a means of either education or entertainment.</p>

                    <h1>Facebook</h1>
                    <p>With nearly 2.5 billion monthly users, Facebook is hands down the largest social media site in
                        the
                        world. While that practically ensures at least some of your audience regularly uses the
                        platform,
                        it’s developed a somewhat negative reputation amongst younger users that are increasingly
                        turning to
                        other alternative sites.

                        Regardless, if your brand stands to benefit from sharing industry-related news, engaging
                        (short-form) videos, graphics and other visually appealing content—especially if your primary
                        audience is above the age of 30—then consider having a presence on Facebook. You might also
                        consider
                        leveraging Facebook groups to gather your customers or community in one place online. Facebook
                        groups, unlike Facebook business pages, aren’t for advertising, but they can be helpful in
                        creating
                        conversation.

                        Who’s on Facebook (and Why): 68% of U.S. adults report using Facebook, with 51% saying they’re
                        active multiple times daily. Usage is spread pretty evenly amongst males and females, while
                        users
                        tend to get increasingly active as age increases (especially beyond the 40+ year old
                        demographic).

                        The Content that Works Best on Facebook: The more interesting, engaging or even polarizing your
                        content is, the more likely it is to go viral on Facebook. Lean heavily on short videos,
                        eye-catching images and attention-grabbing headlines to attract an audience. For Facebook
                        groups,
                        interactive content and conversation-starters are the way to go. Consider live streams and
                        polls.

                        You Should Prioritize Facebook if: You want to reach an audience of adults and have engaging
                        visual
                        (or video) content that can capture their attention, invoke an immediate emotional response and
                        make
                        them excited to share with their friends. Or if you want an easy way to create an online
                        community
                        around a topic or business.</p>

                    <h1>Twitter</h1>
                    <p>While Twitter’s monthly active user numbers have hovered consistently around 300 million for a
                        while
                        now, a whopping 40% of those users are active on the site multiple times daily, suggesting that
                        if
                        your audience uses the platform, they’re likely very engaged. The popularity of this social
                        media
                        site remains high amongst tech-savvy users and is particularly active in B2B verticals related
                        to
                        business, marketing and politics today.

                        Who’s on Twitter (and Why): 63% of Twitter users are between the ages of 35 and 65, with males
                        making up nearly two-thirds of those people.

                        The Content that Works Best on Twitter: Twitter has become a very popular medium to communicate
                        breaking news, digest bite-sized content, and communicate directly with your users in real-time.
                        Videos and images tend to stand out best, but a well-timed written tweet still works wonders if
                        you’re hopping on trending topics and are particularly witty.

                        You Should Prioritize Twitter if: Your audience skews toward the demographic of mature males
                        between
                        the ages of 30 and 60. Experiment with a combination of content types ranging from educational
                        videos, to gripping visuals and discussion threads that offer advice and opinions.</p>

                    <h1>TikTok</h1>
                    <p>This new kid on the block is less than two years old, but received over 1 billion downloads of
                        their
                        video-based app during their first year of operation. Today, TikTok reportedly sees over 800
                        million
                        monthly users, which instantly places it amongst the top social media platforms in the world in
                        terms of sheer user figures.

                        Who’s on TikTok (and Why): Around 50% of TikTok’s audience is under the age of 35 in the U.S.,
                        with
                        the majority of that audience concentrated amongst those between the ages of 16 to 24.

                        The Content that Works Best on TikTok: Entertaining, interesting, comedic and sometimes
                        nonsensical
                        short-form video content, usually set to the tune of popular songs. Think fun, catchy
                        music-video
                        style content.

                        You Should Prioritize TikTok if: You want to reach (and entertain) a young audience with fun
                        video-based content that doesn’t often have a direct connection to your products or services.
                        Being
                        overly self-promotional on this platform won’t build you a loyal following, so be prepared to
                        take
                        the approach of entertaining first.</p>

                    <h1>Pinterest</h1>
                    <p>Pinterest has become a very popular social bookmarking tool for saving ideas and finding creative
                        inspiration when it comes to everything from cooking to DIY home projects, vacation ideas,
                        interior
                        design, business and everything in between. With an audience predominantly consisting of adult
                        women, this social media platform is also often cited as a crucial part of the product discovery
                        journey.

                        Who’s on Pinterest (and Why): With over 320 million monthly users, Pinterest boasts one of the
                        most
                        concentrated audiences of women amongst all social media sites. Nearly 80% of their users are
                        female, with a heavy concentration amongst millennials.

                        The Content that Works Best on Pinterest: Vertically-formatted images do best on this platform,
                        due
                        largely to the browsing experience users are presented with. Polished imagery with clear copy
                        that
                        conveys what the Pinner will see if they click through performs best. Numbers, lists, and quotes
                        should be a big part of your strategy here. And don’t forget to consider keywords and search
                        terms
                        in your imagery.

                        You Should Prioritize Pinterest if: Your audience consists predominantly of adult women, your
                        business is related to lifestyle, fashion, decorating, or DIY.

                    <p>Despite seeming to lose some ground to competitor social media platforms like Instagram and
                        TikTok,
                        Snapchat still remains one of the most heavily used apps with the under 25 years of age
                        demographic—boasting over 300 million monthly users in recent months. Most Snapchat users
                        frequent
                        the app in order to share updates and communicate with friends and family through disappearing
                        images and short video messages.

                        Who’s on Snapchat (and Why): Young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 make up a massive 78% of
                        active users who partake in the platform’s over 14 billion daily video views. Users tend to skew
                        slightly more toward females, with the majority accessing the app daily.

                        The Content that Works Best on Snapchat: Video-driven storytelling. If you have a knack for
                        creating
                        compelling (usually selfie-style) short videos that can entertain & educate a young audience,
                        then
                        Snapchat is a no brainer platform for you to form connections with your customers.

                        You Should Prioritize Snapchat if: You want to reach a young audience and have an affinity for
                        creating bite-sized, engaging video content. Like with TikTok though, don’t expect to flip on
                        your
                        camera and talk about your products all day, as most Snapchat users are here to be entertained.
